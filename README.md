# QuikCapture
C# application which allows quick screen capture and save them directly to an image file.

The application requires .NET Framework 4.5 and above to run. It has been developed and tested on Windows 7. I am sharing the code files. You can use them to create the exectable.

**How do I use it? :confused:**

Just run the application and speicy the path in which you would want to save the screenshot image files. It will perform a fullscreen screenshot, that is the entire desktop. Once the path is provided, click on the enable button.

When you want to take screenshot, just press the 'PrntScrn' button and it will automatically save the screenshot as JPG in the path specified with a folder named as today's date and the time during which the application was launched.

The application can be minimized and you can continue to use it, while it is in the background. :heart:
